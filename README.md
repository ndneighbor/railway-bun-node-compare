cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your DATABASE_URL and other settings

# Deploy to Railway (package-lock.json included for reproducible builds)
railway login
railway link  # Link to your Railway project
railway up    # Deploy Node version
```

### 4. Deploy Bun Implementation

## üî¨ Performance Monitoring

### Real-time Metrics Collection
Both implementations automatically collect:
- Response times for all endpoints
- Memory usage per request
- Request throughput
- Error rates
- Database query performance

### Cross-Service Comparison
Each service can query the other's metrics for real-time comparison:
- Average response times
- Memory consumption patterns
- Throughput differences
- Performance improvement percentages

### Load Testing Scenarios
Built-in benchmark scenarios:
- **Startup**: Cold start performance measurement
- **Light**: 10 concurrent users for 60 seconds
- **Medium**: 50 concurrent users for 120 seconds
- **Heavy**: 100 concurrent users for 180 seconds
- **Database**: Complex queries with joins
- **Mixed**: Combined read/write operations

## üöÄ Railway Deployment

### Environment Variables

Both implementations require these environment variables:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/database

# Application
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key

# Performance Monitoring
BENCHMARK_ENABLED=true
RUNTIME_NAME=node  # or "bun" for bun implementation
COMPARISON_SERVICE_URL=https://other-service.railway.app

# Railway (set automatically)
RAILWAY_STATIC_URL=
RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=
```

### Deployment Commands

Deploy Node.js implementation:
```bash
cd node-implementation
railway up
```

Deploy Bun implementation:
```bash
cd bun-implementation
railway up
```

### Health Checks
Both services include comprehensive health checks:
- HTTP endpoint: `GET /api/health`
- Docker health checks with automatic retries
- Performance metrics validation

## üèÅ Running Benchmarks

### Local Development
```bash
# Start Node.js service (terminal 1)
cd node-implementation
npm install
npm run dev

# Start Bun service (terminal 2)
cd bun-implementation
bun install
bun run dev

# Run benchmarks (terminal 3)
node benchmark-runner.js
```

The benchmark runner provides:
- Detailed performance metrics per endpoint
- Response time percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- Throughput comparison (requests per second)
- Memory usage analysis
- Winner determination with improvement percentages
- JSON export for further analysis

Example output:
```

```

## üîß Development

### Database Migrations
Run database migrations:
```bash
# Node.js implementation
cd node-implementation

npm run seed

# Bun implementation
cd bun-implementation
bun run migrate
bun run seed
```

### Adding New Endpoints
1. Add route handler to both implementations
2. Update API documentation in README
3. Add benchmark scenario to `benchmark-runner.js`
4. Test cross-runtime compatibility

### Performance Monitoring Setup
Both implementations include:
- Automatic metrics collection middleware
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Database storage of performance data
- Cross-service comparison endpoints

## üìà Performance Analysis

### Key Metrics Tracked
- **Response Time**: Average, min, max, and percentiles
- **Memory Usage**: Heap usage per request
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Error Rate**: Failed requests percentage
- **Database Performance**: Query execution times

### Comparison Features
- Real-time performance dashboard
- Historical performance trends
- Cross-runtime benchmark results
- Memory usage patterns
- Load testing scenarios

### Expected Results
Based on runtime characteristics:
- **Bun**: Generally faster startup and lower memory usage
- **Node.js**: More consistent performance under sustained load
- **Database Operations**: Similar performance due to shared PostgreSQL
- **Static Content**: Bun typically serves faster
- **Complex Logic**: Performance varies by implementation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Failed**
```bash
# Check DATABASE_URL format
# Ensure PostgreSQL service is running
# Verify Railway database credentials
```

**Service Not Responding**
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Verify health endpoint
curl https://your-service.railway.app/api/health
```

**Benchmark Runner Errors**
```bash
# Ensure both services are accessible
# Check CORS settings for cross-origin requests
# Verify API endpoints are responding
```

**WebSocket Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check firewall settings
# Ensure WebSocket upgrade is working
# Verify /ws/metrics endpoint
```

### Development Tips
1. Use Railway logs for debugging deployment issues
2. Test endpoints individually before running full benchmarks
3. Monitor database connection limits during load testing
4. Use Railway's built-in metrics for additional insights
